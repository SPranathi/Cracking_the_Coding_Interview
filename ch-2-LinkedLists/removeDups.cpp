/*
PROBLEM:
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

Example:
1 1 2 3 4 4 

TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(n), because we iterate through the singly linked list only once, performing constant
work over each element.

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
O(n), because in the worst case we store each element in the hashmap.
